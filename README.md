## How to prepare

Start nsqd in docker

```bash
make up
```

## Architecture

![arch](data/images/message-queue.jpeg)

Design of nsq - https://nsq.io/overview/design.html

## Run producer

```bash
STREAM=foo make producer
```

Events will be generated to the stream `foo` every 1 second.

```bash
STREAM=foo PAYLOAD_KEYS=10000 GOROUTINES=10 make producer
```

- `PAYLOAD_KEYS=1000` - number of keys in payload, approximately 1Mb for each message
- `GOROUTINES=10` - number of goroutines to generate messages independently

## Run consumers with different groups

```bash
STREAM=foo GROUP=1 make consumer
STREAM=foo GROUP=2 make consumer
```

Each consumer will receive the same events from the stream `foo`.
We will try to use 1-1 mapping between group and consumer, in that case
each consumer can ack message regardless how to use other consumers.

## Run consumers with the same group

```bash
STREAM=foo GROUP=1 make consumer
STREAM=foo GROUP=1 make consumer
```

Each consumer will receive different events from the stream `foo`.
Pretty close how to load balancer works in round-robin mode.

## Run consumers with the same group with timeout

```bash
STREAM=foo GROUP=1 TIMEOUT=30 make consumer
```

Consumer will wait new messages for 30 seconds. If no messages will be received, consumer will exit.

## Run socket activation (systemd) consumer for development

It uses systemd-socket-activate to listen on a socket and launch consumer when new data arriving in socket.

```bash
STREAM=foo TIMEOUT=30 make systemd-socket-activate-consumer
```

Starts the consumer with systemd socket activation. The consumer will be started by systemd when a new data is received
on the socket `/var/run/sa-consumer.sock`.

## Run wakeup service

Subscribe for new messages and send wakeup signal (open connect to socket) to the consumer.
Also, it checks unprocessed messages for every consumer and wakeup them if needed.

```bash
make wakeup
```

Under the hood it collects all streams and their groups from nsqd, checks the name of group for valid socket
file type.
If it exists ->

1. Check consumers have unprocessed messages - wake them up if messages is exists
2. Subscribe to new messages for further wakeup consumers.

## Run with systemd

```bash
make reload-systemd-consumer
systemctl enable mqueue-consumer-nsq.socket
systemctl enable mqueue-consumer-nsq.service
systemctl start mqueue-consumer-nsq.socket
make wakeup
```

Services are ready to receive new messages, to generate a new one - run producer.

Show logs of consumer:

```bash
journalctl -u mqueue-consumer-nsq.service
```
